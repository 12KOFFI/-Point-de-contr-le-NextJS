This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the development server for your Next.js project. It allows you to preview your application locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Make sure you have all dependencies installed by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the development server, ensure that your environment variables are properly configured if your project relies on them. You can define them in a `.env.local` file at the root of your project.

Once the server is running, you can make changes to your code, and the application will automatically reload to reflect those changes.
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
